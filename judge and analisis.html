         <h2>An analysis of the conflict itself, its resolution and judgment</h2>

           <h3>The start of the conflict:</h3>
            <p>The conflict started when the Yalta conference was held between the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States; in which they agreed for the liberated countries to do democracies so that they could decide what power they wanted to be ruled by. But the Soviet Union broke the agreement and forced communist government between all of Eastern Europe. Ever since then, the truce between the Soviet Union and the United States broke apart giving birth to the Cold War conflict. Which was a competition for militar, economical, and political power.
           <br>Moreover, while the Soviet Union was a communist system which wanted to redistribute wealth, promote powers, and viewed religion as dangerous; the United States was a capitalist system which was against communism, wanted to let free markets determine the distribution of goods, as well as the right for people to choose whatever religion they wanted.</p>

            <h3 id="he1">How they fought:</h3>
            <p id="p1">They initially fought by space racing, military racing, and more specially by arm racing. Thanks to their investment on space, arm, technology and militarism, their economies were getting really affected. Especially on part of the Soviet Union who didn’t really care for its people. Later on, their nuclear weapons were getting so advanced that it almost caused a nuclear war. As a result of avoiding a nuclear war, both sides started to create agreements, and proxy wars to avoid bigger or more serious confrontations.</p>

            <h3 id="he2">How it ended:</h3>
            <p>The end of the cold war started when Gorbachev began his government reforms which included political and economic freedoms (Glasnost and Perestroika), which favored Eastern countries' protest for their rights and liberty. Not much time later In a blink of an eye, East Germany turned down the Berlin war, 15 nations became independent, and the Soviet Union turned apart and became what we know today as Russia.</p>

            <h3 id="he3">which side was justified:</h3>
            <p>In the end we can say that what the United States did was basically a defensive reaction towards the Soviet Union's aggressive behavior in order to prevent another World War. Although we can say that the United States was the good one during the cold war, it doesn't justify its use and development of atomic weapons. Nevertheless, it is the Soviet Union the one that can’t be justified at all since they made people's lives miserable, and oppressed their freedom and rights, in order to gain power. As the US president Kennedy said  “Democracy might not be perfect, but we have never had to put a wall to keep people in”. Therefore, it is clear that the United States' intention was much better than its counterpart. </p>

            <p>During the Cold War, the world became divided into two dominant  blocs led by the United States and the Soviet Union. This division led to significant global implication, this created  a tense  geopolitical place where each bloc expanded its influence and ideology. 
                The Western bloc, led by the United States, supported capitalism and democracy. It made alliances with the NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) To counter the perceived danger from the Soviet Union and its allies.</p>

            <p>The process of decolonization during the Cold War was really complex. with emerging nations strategically taking advantage of the rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union to secure their independence. As the two of them started to weaken. nationalist movements ably navigated the dynamics of the Cold War, aligning themselves with either the United States or the Soviet Union to gain support. This geopolitical event influenced economic objectives for resource control and social changes, ultimately dismantling colonial structures.
                <br>Decolonization during the Cold War was a monumental global shift that reshaped the geopolitical landscape.
                <br>With the decline of European colonial powers, many colonized nations strategically navigated the rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union to achieve their goals. Nationalist leaders adeptly played off superpower interests, securing support for their independence struggles</p>
