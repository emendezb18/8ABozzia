       <center><h3>During War:</h3></center> 
        <p>After WWll, the United States and the Soviet Union emerged as the new powers. Due to them, the world was divided in two creating a bipolar system. The war boundaries were known as the Western bloc, and the Eastern bloc. The Western bloc was led by the United States and included democratic states of Western Europe, America, Oceania, and some parts of Asia. The Eastern bloc was led by the Soviet Union and included communist states of Eastern Europe, Asia, and some parts of Africa and Latin America.

        <center><h3> After War: </h3></center>
        <p>On December 25, 1991, the Soviet Union collapsed. At the end, its collapse resulted in the end of the country, and its federal government causing 15 republics to gain full independence.<br><br>
            While the Soviet Union fell apart, the Western gained more allies. During the war, NATO, which was part of the Western Allies with 16 members, gained a total of 15 new members. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Western Union took advantage and started to center on gaining allies from the Eastern bloc.<br><br>
            In addition, the bipolar system ended and a multipolar system started. New powers like China, India and Brazil emerged; and new regional blocs such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, and the European Union emerged.
